This downloads canadian weather forecast data.

To create a virtualenv and use it::

    virtualenv venv
    ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

The only thing in here right now is to download the Environment Canada
ATOM feed and pull out the next few days' forecast high and
low. Change the URI in the script.
